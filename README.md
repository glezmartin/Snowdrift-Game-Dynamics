# Snowdrift Game Dynamics
This project studies the evolution of the behavior of the individuals of a community in the snowdrift game as a function of the parameters of the game and the topology of the players' social network.

## Introduction

This project seeks to build a model that simulates the dynamics of the evolution of player strategies in a community while playing a game. Each player can choose between the two available strategies to cooperate (C) or not to cooperate (D). The objective is to study how a population behaves according to the characteristics of the game.

We can classify the existing games in an ST plane of coordinates S and T - for Sucker's and Temptation, which are the respective payoffs of a cooperator and a defector when they face each other. This would result in a payoff matrix like this one

By varying the values of the parameters <S, T> we change the payout matrices, so that the strategy that each player will follow will vary, obtaining the following types of games
